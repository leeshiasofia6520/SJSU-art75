## ▼△▼△▼ Assignments
##### Project 1: Non-Narrative Video
1-3 minutes of edited audio/video. Students will first create the audio component, and then craft the video imagery for the piece. Emphasis will be on the different forms in which non-narrative meaning can be constructed—including abstraction, montage, documentation of performance, and sampling of existing material.
##### Project 2: Performance Art / Experimental Documentary / Video essay
Create a documentation of performance art, experimental documentary, or video essay piece with a total of no more than 10 minutes of edited video. Students are encouraged to depart from the single-channel video format and present designs for their piece as a gallery or web-based installation.
##### Project 3: Net Art
Design two interactive Net Art pieces using the p5.js JavaScript library. Emphasis is on Net Art as tactical media, critical/queer re-imagining of interactivity, and generative art / code-driven image creation.

***Project 3a***
1) Make images (or animations) move on screen. These can be static images, animated sprites, or text.  

And / Or

2) Access and manipulate HTML elements with P5. For example, when the mouse rolls over a heading on the webpage, THEN something happens.

***Project 3b***
The second part of the project is more flexible in its requirements: The prompt is to come up with an idea for any interactive, web-based piece and to execute it.

##### Project 4: Final Project
For the Final Project, students may explore any of the techniques/subjects outlined in the course. A more refined approach will be expected.  
<br> <br>
*and...*
##### Website and Artists Statements
Students will create or add to an existing artist portfolio site, improving use of HTML/CSS/Javascript and general approaches to documentation. This will also include an artist statement that speaks to your general approach to your work and for each assignment. There will be 3 milestone reviews of your website through the course of the semester.

| Conceptual Approach to Work     | The Student takes critical and/or expressive approach to approaching a subject as an artist. The Student is able to take the essence and spirit of the conceptual ideas for the assignment and interpret, synthesize and contextualize with great facility. The student demonstrates a keen understanding of the content of the course material, and  is able make it their own idea with their own personal style. The final work not only meets the criteria but it exceeds it.                                                                                               | The Student demonstrates a sincere attempt to engage in the conceptual ideas of the assignments. Most of the details and nuance of the conceptual idea behind the assignment is addressed in the work. The student clearly has understood what was expected, and the quality of the response is good but not stellar in its insight to the ideas. The work shows an understanding of the ideas but perhaps not a facility that creates a more thoughtfully realized solution. | The Student demonstrates a limited amount of understanding of the assignment and the idea(s) that reflect this in the work is only a mostly superficial interpretation of the requirements of the work. More thought and more consideration of how the ideas of the assignment could be used with their own experience and perspective. | The Student only shows the slightest understanding of the assignment and can only demonstrate a cursory understanding of the intent of the assignment. There is a general failure to follow the intent and nuance of the assignment and has made something that can only be described as something that needs a great deal of work before its considered something that is complete and meeting the requirements. |
| Technical Approach to Work      | The Student demonstrate a clear mastery of the material and is able to demonstrate exemplarily capabilities with creating the technical aspects of the assignments. The student demonstrate a great facility for not just doing basic constructions but are able to tackle more advanced implementations and succeed in there functionality.                                                                                                                                       | The Student demonstrates a clear capability with the tools and material. The majority of the assignment is well crafted, and assembled to completion. Some parts could be refined and with further work the assignment could better reflect the intent of the idea. The work can be thought of as a good example of what is required to complete the assignment.                                                                                                              | The Student demonstrates only a modest amount of skill in the production of the assignment. Several details key to the assignment or either missing, or represented in the most basic implementation. The assignment lacks a sense of finesse, and appears to be constructed with out much attention to detail and nuance.              | The works is clearly either incomplete or demonstrates a complete lack of understanding the tools and approach to completing the assignment. There is no evidence that the student has gained much skill in the required tools needed to complete the assignment.                                                                                                                                                 |
| Organizational Approach to Work | All the student assignments are described and communicated with clarity and detail for every step of the assignment. Student shows a multitude of sketches at initial stages, and shows tangible progress up until the final version is presented. All correspondence with instructor and other classmates is clear and in a timely matter. They participate in all phases of the assignment and contribute a great deal to the social and critical evaluations of everyones work. | The Student makes clear attempts to show progress on their assignments to not just the instructor but to the class as well. There is regular participation in all the phases of the assignment and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | The Student shows limited engagement in the process of each assignment. There is a modest amount of participation with the assignment, and a minimum amount of effort to share progress with where they are in the process of the assignment.                                                                                           | The student all but abandons any attempt to coordinate and demonstrate their work with the instructor and class with their intension and ideas put forth in the assignment. there is no sharing of rough drafts or first attempts, nor is their much attempt to get feedback or share their thoughts on the assignment with anyone.                                                                               |

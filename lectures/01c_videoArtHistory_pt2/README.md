## PART 2: 1980s and 90s

#### ***1980s***


***Reading:*** ["Video: Shedding the Utopian Moment" Martha Rosler](https://monoskop.org/images/1/12/Rosler_Martha_1986_1991_Video_Shedding_the_Utopian_Moment.pdf)

By 1980s, the more utopian visions of the '60s had vanished. Artists were focusing more on content and exploring post-production techniques of fades/wipes, layered video & text, animation, etc.

Home viewer technology was also advancing. The JVC VHS tape beat the Sony Betamax in the so-called "Video Tape Format Wars" of the 1970s, largely due to it's affordability. By the '80s, VHS decks and TV sets were a must-have pairing.

Affordable VHS technology made appropriation of popular images more accessible. TV could now be sampled and remixed. Artists such as Joan Braderman and Dara Birnbaum used clips from TV shows to construct feminist critiques.

Joan Bradermanâ€”a self-identified stand-up theoristâ€”was one of the early artists featured on [Paper Tiger Television](http://papertiger.org/). Established in 1981, Paper Tiger TV continues to be an innovative, alternative media hub for artists making bold, raw critiques of mass media and politics.

[Deep Dish TV](http://www.deepdishtv.org/) is another notable radical media producer (and first US grassroots satellite network). Founded in the 1980s, DDTV [continues to produce](https://vimeo.com/deepdishtv) political DIY journalism to this day.

Needless to say, DIY Media activists continued to wield video cameras as both weapon and muse. [DIVA TV (Damned Interfering Video Activists)](http://www.actupny.org/divatv/) documented ACT UP protests. [ACT UP](http://www.actupny.org/)â€”the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Powerâ€”spearheaded creative direct actions that fought for visibility, research, and policy on behalf of people living with HIV/AIDS, before the government recognized it as a crisis.

DIVA TV was a NYC collective of lesbians who used video documentation as a form as accountability and resistance, as [Third World Newsreel](http://www.twn.org/) did in the 1960s using 8mm film, and as the [Indymedia movement](https://www.indymedia.org/or/index.shtml) would fifteen years later.

From the horrors, struggle, resistance, and loss of the AIDS crisis came the unification of the LGBTQ community. The 1980s saw an emergence of Queer film and video festivals.

 LGBTQ artists used video to author their own histories, exploring topics of identity, gender, and sexuality. The young Sadie Benning used Pixelvisionâ€”a lo-fi toy cameraâ€”to document her budding sexuality.

</br>
</br>

Benning's use of the Pixelvision camera created grainy images that harkened back to the aesthetic of early video.

Similarly, Swiss artist Pipilotti Rist makes use of the vertical roll and video interference in her piece [*I'm Not The Girl Who Mises Much*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjvWXiUp1hI) (1986).

<br>

Video is already nostalgic for itself â€” the vertical roll and interference is something of the past. Her use of it draws attention to the changing nature the medium, as well as being homage to early video art (ie. Joan Jonas' *Vertical Roll* from 1972).

 #### ***Late 80s-90s***

The late 80s early 90s saw a right-wing attack against art, artists, and LGBTQ communities. Non-profits and artists grants lost funding. Fortunately, despite the decline in production and exhibition, cheaper video technologies were being developed, and the internet was born.

Hi8 cameras allowed for better quality images, soon followed by digital video (DV), and non-linear editing software of Avid and Final Cut.

Conceptually, the move from magnetic tape to digital video marked a further distancing from the physical world. Image recording and storage now lives in binary code.

In the gallery world, video was reborn through the economy of "limited editions". Artists Matthew Barney, Bill Viola, and Gary Hill grew to be successful video artists. For the most part, the 1990s saw artists working with less political subject matter than their predecessors.

Artists continued with trends in critiquing television cultural, creating reflections on the mechanisms of mass media that were often without the didacticism present in earlier works. In Pipilotti Rist's installation *Das Zimmer* (1994), the artist created an installation of a living room of gigantic proportions. The viewers â€” gazing at a normal-sized monitor â€” found themselves reduced to a scale of seemingly child-like, naive consumers. <br>

Similar to early critiques of television, examinations into the nature of surveillance took the stage, long before the revelations of Edward Snowden. Surveillance continues to be a major thematic element in video and New Media Art as artists grapple with technology of the Information Age.

Mona Hatoum's piece *Corps etranger* (1994), takes invasion of the body to an extreme, exploring the interior of her body with an endoscopic camera. The images are projected onto the floor of a cylindrical structure, placing viewers within a structure referencing the camera itself.

On the flipside of surveillance, Jennifer Ringley more or less invented reality TV when she started JenniCAM in 1996, broadcasting her life 24/7 for 7 years.

Video installation techniques became more diverse in the 90s. Artists took to creating immersive installations and projected onto a variety of objects and forms. Diana Thater's landmark installation *Delphine* (1999) placed viewers in an immersive underwater architecture.

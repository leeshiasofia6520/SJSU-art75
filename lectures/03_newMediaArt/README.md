## â–¼â–³â–¼â–³â–¼â–³â–¼Intro to New Media Art

>New Media Art is not defined by the technologies, "on the contrary, by deploying these technologies for critical or experimental purposes, New Media artists redefine them as art media."
> -Mark Tribe

New Media Art is not only connected to the historical/cultural moment of the internet, but also to histories and trends in art since the mid 1800s.

* Dada
* Pop Art
* Conceptual Art
* Video Art

New Media is a confluence of pre-existing trends in Art and Technology(electronics/robotics) and Media Art (video, transmission/radio).

He lists A TON of amazing works (some links below), and discusses some trends in New Media Art, including surveillence, hacking & hacktivism, corporate parody, etc.

New Media (and general contemporary culture) has an undeniable fascination in retro-aesthetics. Derrida's term [hauntology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hauntology) is an interesting lens to view its theoretical underpinnings.

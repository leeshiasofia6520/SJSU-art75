## â–¼â–³â–¼â–³â–¼â–³â–¼ Video's Inception: 1960's anti-establishment politics, idealism, and the Sony Portapak
</br>

#### ***1950s***
</br>
The 1950s were a time of consumerism and conformity. At the hearth of every nuclear family: the boobtube.
</br>

![Television reigned in the 1950s](images/WelcomeToTelevision.jpg)
</br>
</br>
</br>

---
#### ***1960s***
</br>
The 1960s were a time of radical social change driven by the civil rights movement, ideological expansion, and an anti-establishment youth movement.
</br>

![War protests](images/fuckTheDraft.jpg)
</br>

It was at this moment that consumer video cameras hit the market. Media activists saw video as a democratizing form of media production that would challenge the television monopolies, revolutionizing the relationship between producer and consumer.
</br>
</br>
</br>

---
#### ***The Sony Portapak 1965***


The Sony Portapak was the first video camera available to the consumer. Prior to the Portapak all means of production and broadcast were controlled by government and corporate media.
</br>

Actually intended for small business and industrial uses, the Portapak was clunkyâ€”with an  external recording deck separate from the cameraâ€”and sometimes took two people to operate.  
</br>

![Shooting with Portapak](images/portapak_1.jpg)
</br>
*Sony Portapak*
</br>

Media activists, empowered by access to media production, revolted against the 1950s TV empire of their youth by producing their own images distinct from corporate control. Many saw video as a democratizing form that would challenge the television monopolies, something that would enable them to revolutionize the relationship between producer and consumer.
</br>

> Video reversed the process of television, giving people access to the tools of production and distribution, giving them control over their own images and, by implication their own lives     </br>- Radical Software 1:1

> "TV has been attacking us all our lives, now we can attack it back."
<br>- Nam June Paik

#### ***Marshall McLuhan***
</br>

![Marshall McLuhan](images/mcLuhan.jpg)
</br> </br>
A prominent media theorist of the time, McLuhan's ideas were hugely influential to early video artists and activists. His phrase "the medium is the message" states that the medium itself is embedded in whatever message it might convey.

> "The new electronic independence re-creates the world in the image of a global village." <br> - Marshall McLuhan

> McLuhanâ€™s ideas placed technology at the center of human transformation and emphasized that the emerging technology not only would transform consciousness but also provide a very powerful path to social change. </br>
-Kate Horsfield: *Busting the Tube*

#### ***Technological Utopianism***

What are parallels between video's [technological utopianism](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_utopianism) and the [cyber-utopianism](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber-utopianism) of the early internet?

*Next weeks reading* â€” [Critical Art Ensemble *Utopian Promises, Net Realities*](../../readings/critical-art-ensemble_Utopian-Promises-Net-Realities.pdf)

</br>
</br>


## â–¼â–³â–¼â–³â–¼â–³â–¼ Video Art History

##### Two principle groups staked claim in the medium:
1. media activists
2. artists creating performance-based conceptual works or formal inquiries into the nature of the medium

</br>
</br>

### ***----> 1: Media Activists***


Sometimes called "guerilla television", media activists saw themselves as players in a war-like operation against dominant media.

![Videofreex Collective](images/videofreex-with-cameras.png)
</br> *Videofreex Collective members*

Because professional editing systems were expensive, people were limited to editing by manually copying footage from one deck to another. Often videos were single shots. The collectives' grainy, unedited reporting stood in contrast to polished corporate mediaâ€”this aesthetic of DIY citizen journalism was (and still is) coded as being more "authentic".

#### ***Collectives***

Collective life-styles were a hallmark of the times, and video collectives popped up in New York City and West Coast.

 [Videofreex](https://videofreex.com/) </br> Raindance </br> Global Village </br> People's Video Theater | Ant Farm </br> Video Free America </br> Optic Nerve </br> Top Value Television


You can view clips from Videofreex' guerilla reporting on [Video Data Bank's Videofreex Archive](http://www.vdb.org/collection/Videofreex%20Archive). Archiving the Arts also has a [fairly recent interview](http://www.imappreserve.org/archivingarts/videofreex/) with them.
</br>
</br>

Ant Farm took a different approach to many of their works, staging media spectacles that appropriated images of popular icons.

#### ***Radical Software***

[Radical Software](http://www.radicalsoftware.org/e/index.html) was a journal alternative media makers published by members of the Raindance collective.

Radical Software spoke of technology as a cultural force, presenting a cybernetic (network/system-based) approach to understand it, and called this media "ecology." Early proponents of information freedom, they created a new copyright symbol: a crossed out circle meaning: "please copy."

#### ***Artists occupying the airwaves***

![Facing a Family](https://www.eai.org/user_files/images/title/_xl/export_family_xl.jpg) <br>

In [Facing a Family](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mBxoDvB5xI) (1971), VALIE EXPORT, an Austrian feminist performance artist, filmed a family as they were eating dinner with the camera positioned from the TV's perspective. The work was broadcast on Austrian television â€” EXPORT wanted the audience to consider the passive role we take in TV spectatorship, and to reflect on the disjunction between TV fantasy and living-room reality.
<br>
<br>

*TV Interruptions: Tap piece*, David Hall (1971)

Also making use of the airways, Scottish artist David Hall produced a series of [*TV Interruptions*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AA9IdHtHk_0) that were broadcast anonymously on Scottish Television in 1971.

Chris Burden's *TV Commercials* (1973-1977)

In the US, artist Chris Burden infiltrated the airways by purchasing commercial time on broadcast television and aired his own 'ads.'

### ***----> 2: The Art World***

Many experimental artists were drawn to video less out of an interest in affecting social change, but more through Fluxus-inspired ambitions to subjugate the standard relationships between artist and viewer, and redefine/undermine the commercial conventions of the art world.

Artists also made formalist inquiries into the new medium, exploring its essential qualities as one would do in painting, photography, or sculpture.
<br>
<br>

![Nam June Paik](images/220px-Portrait_of_Nam_June_Paik-by_Lim_Young-kyun-1981.jpg) </br> *Nam June Paik*

Nam Jun Paik is often heralded as the first video artist. Coming out of the Fluxus movement, he moved television beyond its normal associations and subverted it as object and subject in art performances and installations.

In *TV Cello* (1964) he creates a fully-functional cello out of three TV sets for avant-garde cellist Charlotte Moorman. One TV shows an image of Moorman performing live, another a montage of other cellists, and the third an intercepted TV broadcast.

### ***Video and Performance Art***

Video was commonly used in art as a tool for documenting performance.

Most was conceptual art that centered idea and process over form. Artists used the intimacy of video to explore body and self as site of relation to society.

![Vito Acconci *Pryings*](http://www.vdb.org/sites/default/files/clip_images/PRYINGS.jpg)</br>

Vito Acconci plays with the discomfort of social power relations in [*Pryings*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0JbuHDMxVU), 1971.

William Wegman often took a lighter approachâ€”his dogs were both subject and muse.

*Stamping in the Studio* Brue Nauman (1968)

Bruce Nauman's early video works played with the mechanization and de-personalization of the human body. He made use of the immediacy and intimacy of portable video and recorded himself in his studio, often placing the camera at an odd angle to achieve a greater level of abstraction.

In *SHOOT* (1971) Chris Burden captured the human body in extreme states of fear and pain in a landmark piece of extreme performance art. His friend fired at him with a 22 calibre rifle, puncturing his upper arm.

#### ***Trends in formalism***

Artists who took a formalist approach to video employed the technology of video as content as well as the form for their work.

These were investigations into the intrinsic properties of the medium, ie. feedback, the intimacy of real-time recordings and the size of the images produced.

In *Vertical Roll*, video provided Joan Jonas a means to explore the disjunction between performance and a recording of that performance. Here, a performance of her alter-ego belly dancer Organic Honey is fragmented by a roll caused by varying framerates in video recording and playback.

![Joan Jonas' *Vertical Roll](images/jonas_verticalRoll.jpg) </br>
[Watch Joan Jonas' *Vertical Roll* 1972](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpstpzBDJ7s)
<br>

This formal inquiry expanded into installation space. Live feedback systems made viewers not only spectators but also subject of the art work, calling to light the nature of immediate playback and the disjunction between the video recording and physical space.

In *Live/Taped Video Corridor*, Nauman placed a TV at the end of narrow corridor. As viewers approached the televisions â€” one showing the empty room and another a live image of the viewer in the space â€” they see their own image recede as they get closer.

#### ***Video Synthesizers***

More advanced post-production technologies (keying, colorizing) were developed in 1970s, but still were expensive and inaccessible to most consumers. Artists who wanted to work with special effects needed to engineer their own special effects synthesizers, creating early works in generative video, and computational media.

#### ***Institutional Expansion in the 1970s***


- *More formal art funding from state*
- *Nonprofit media arts centers that offered low-cost access*
- *Acceptance of video into art academy â€” schools added video and performance art studies into curriculum*


Video had value in academia in that it lent itself to cross-disciplinary practices. It was a vehicle for creative explorations of theory as "video essays", tying in performance, identity, feminism, psychology, cultural studies, etc.

Here is a very famous example:

![Martha Rosler "Semiotics of the Kitchebn"](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/40/Semiotics_of_the_Kitchen_screenshot.jpg)

[Watch Martha Rosler's *Semiotics of the Kitchen* (1975)](https://vimeo.com/116580896)

Donna Haraway â€” author of *Cyborg Manifesto* and current scholar at UC Santa Cruz â€” used video as a vehicle to convey her associative historical/cultural theories on the conception of 'man'.  

![Donna Haraway](http://papertiger.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/PTTV_EP_126.png)

[Watch *Donna Haraway reads 'The National Geographic' on Primates* (1987)](https://vimeo.com/218047623)
</br>
</br>

In contrast to it's success in the academy, video art was struggling to find a home in the 1970s gallery world. Unlike painting/sculpture/photography, it was hard to sell.

Gallery collections dissolved into nonprofit archives: [Video Data Bank](https://www.vdb.org/) & [Electronic Arts Intermix](https://www.eai.org/), whose invaluable archival work continue to be excellent resources to this day.

## Problematizing Video Art History
</br>

["Paradox in the Evolution of an Art Form: Great Expectations and the Making of a History" Marita Sturken](http://pzacad.pitzer.edu/~mma/teaching/MS71/reading/sturken-1.pdf)


>"Histories do not simply evolve, they are *constructed* through certain agendas... (most commonly written out of history are women and people of color.)" - Marita Sturken

>Video has, from the beginning, had a very self-conscious relationship to it's own history.  "Not only was video being 'invented,' it was being staked out and claimed." -Marita Sturken

</br>

Video, no doubt, was ridden by a Post-modern self-consciousness. From the beginning, video artists sought to define the medium and claim their title in its history.

Video art history was being written simultaneously as the work was produced. This certainly could have been a mechanism for institutional survival, and also a result of the rapidly deteriorating mediumâ€”tapes might melt away, but written interpretations will last. Regardless, there are a few myths that resulted....


#### ***Myths of Video Collectives***

* In contrast to the portrayal of the radical collective spirit, many of the collectives were hierarchical and male-dominated. Raindance in fact started as a profit-making think tank. Its name was a riff on corporate R&D Research & Development
* Collectives are iconicized as anti-establishment and in opposition to TV, but artists from beginning were trying to get on the airwaves. 1969 Videofreex & others made a a documentary for CBS about counterculture (never aired). Top Value Television people later hollywood producers


In her article, Marita Sturken unpacks the the inherent paradox: how can one critique the technology while using it?

 >It points to a tendency to believe that machines dictate aesthetic development and a deep-set cultural belief that people do not really control machines but are always on some level conrolled by them. -Sturken

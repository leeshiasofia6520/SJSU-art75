# ▼△▼△▼ Favicons


Favicons are the little symbol in the browser tab of your webpage. To make a custom favicon for your site:

1. Create a SQUARE image in photoshop/illustrator, I make them 500 x 500px so there's plenty of room to downsize. Export them as PNGs if you want transparency (recommended). Keep the image super simple because they will be so small!

2. Upload image to an online [favicon generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/)

3. The favicon generator will create a bundle of favicon image files in different sizes/formats so your favicon will show in different browsers/devices. Download the zip and place files in the root directory of your website. The root directory is the main folder, where your homepage index.html lives.

4. The generator will also give you HTML — this goes in the <head> of your HTML (not the body).

That's it!

# ▼△▼△▼ Custom domains


You can purchase a custom domain from a domain name registrar. GoDaddy and NameCheap are two popular sites.

Once you have purchased your custom domain, connect the domain to your GitHub page. This way, whenever someone goes to www.yourName.com, your GitHub page will load.

# ▼△▼△▼ HTTPS Setting up secure SSL

Good news! As of May 1st 2018, GitHub added HTTPS support for custom domains using GitHub pages! [Here's a tutorial](https://blog.github.com/2018-05-01-github-pages-custom-domains-https/) to set it up.

# ▼△▼△▼ Using frameworks and templates for your CSS styling

You would have to learn a lot about modern CSS to get your website looking clean and mobile-responsive (so that it resizes for readability on mobile phone).

If you want to go this route, be sure to use media queries and (I would recommend) flexbox.

Adapting templates or using a library/framework like Twitter Bootstrap are great options. CSS templates will probably allow for a little more customization, whereas using Twitter Bootstrap is a little more limiting since a lot of the styling is set by the framework.  

### Adapting CSS templates

Templates are great! And it won't be hard to customize or plugin your javascript. There are many resources online ---> [templated.co](https://templated.co/) has a LOT of free templates to use.

Many of these templates use [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) as a preprocessor, so you might want to familiarize yourself with Sass if you go deep into customizing a template.

### Twitter Bootstrap


Twitter Bootstrap is a framework that makes it EASY to create responsive websites that are designed for mobile-first.

If you want to use Twitter Bootstrap, check out [tutorials mentioned in this post](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-way-to-learn-Bootstrap/answer/Singh-Naina?utm_medium=organic&utm_source=google_rich_qa&utm_campaign=google_rich_qa) or go through the [W3 schools tutorials](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap4/default.asp)

# ▼△▼△▼ Tips on making artist portfolios


Your portfolio should represent YOU and YOUR WORK.

It will be hard to do this as a student, since you are still figuring out what kind of work you make. Getting you in the practice of writing and presenting your work in a web portfolio is the goal for now.

For this class, I am looking for:

1. Basic web design (using the code from the [gitHub pages demo](../05a_HTML-CSS_gitHubPage/demo) would be fine)

2. Documentation of the projects you made for this class, with short descriptions about the CONCEPTS behind each piece.

3. A two-paragraph artist statement. A general outline could be:

*Paragraph 1:* Who are you and what do you care about as an artist. What kind of subjects do you explore in your work.

*Paragraph 2:* How does the approaches you take in your work reflect your interests. What do you do to explore the ideas outlined in paragraph 1.

If you are confused about what an artist statement looks like, the website [get your sh*t together](https://www.gyst-ink.com/artist-statement-guidelines/
) lays it out nicely.

#### Video Tutorials

Below is a list of suggestions from Dan Schiffman's YouTube Channel.

Besides watching tutorials to learn, you should watch tutorials to get inspired! Do a Google search for:

"how do I do this cool thing in p5.js"

And see what comes up!

If you think Dan Schiffman is just too 'wacky', try [this tutorial series](https://www.kadenze.com/courses/introduction-to-programming-for-the-visual-arts-with-p5-js/info). It is bone-dry.

#### *Coding Train Recommended tutorials:*

**(Suggestions below are all from [Coding Train's p5.js Playlist)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8j0UDiN7my4&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA)**

Introductory concepts:

1.3 Basics of Drawing

If you are already familiar with those topics, I recommend jumping to [Chapter 8: HTML, CSS and DOM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URSH0QpxKo8&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6bI1SlcCRfLH79HZrFAtBvX)

This is how p5 interacts with HTML and CSS on the webpage.

[Playlist on working with APIs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJaXOFfwGVw&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6a-SQiI4RtIwuOrLJGnel0r) (you can think of an API like a bank of information hosted by another site that you can use in your code).

With APIs you can do things like access the New York Times archives, Wikipedia, the current location of all people in space, and [load gifs from Giphy searches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mj8_w11MvH8&index=10&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6a-SQiI4RtIwuOrLJGnel0r

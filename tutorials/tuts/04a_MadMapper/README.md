**Introduction to Projection Mapping**
<br>
<br>
Projection mapping is a technique that involves video projection onto objects, rooms, buildings, or other spaces or surfaces. In specialized software for projection mapping, a two- or three-dimensional object is usually spatially mapped on the virtual program which mimics the real environment it is to be projected on. The software can interact with a projector to fit any desired image onto the surface of that object. There is a great deal of potential with this technique to explore environmental experiences with video, or sculptural objects with video overlays.

Mad Mapper is a great projection mapping program that allows you to import your video, drag your projection map, and export your new file. It is not free, however, so we will use the demo version for class purposes. If you would like to continue to explore projection mapping, you are welcome to acquire your own Mad Mapper version, or you can try [Touch Designer](https://www.derivative.ca/)- another projection mapping program that is free but has a larger learning curve.

**Using Mad Mapper**

![Mapper](images/mapper_1.png)
* Download and install the demo version

![Mapper](images/mapper_2.png)
* There are some limits on the demo version, and a watermark on the projection.

![Mapper](images/mapper_3.png)
* The workspace is very straightforward. You can view your project map and output image at the same time.

* Try importing your own video to experiment with mapping video onto a shape or surface.

*  Your video will play in the Preview monitor.

* On the left, you can begin with a designated shape on the menu and then adjust from there.

## ▼△▼△▼ What is p5 Play

P5 play is a library for the creation of games. It covers BASIC sprite creation, control, and collisions.

Great for play and prototyping in p5, not the best for building out more robust games.

<br>

## ▼△▼△▼ Documentation and demo

Definitely refer to the example code from the [p5 play documentation](http://p5play.molleindustria.org/).

***Note:*** *Spritesheets ARE NOT SUPPORTED in the latest version of p5. You will need to create 'animations' with multiple image files, rather than have all frames compiled in a spriteSheet.*

**Tutorials**

Allison Parish created a [great text tutorial](https://creative-coding.decontextualize.com/making-games-with-p5-play/) on p5.play. It might be a little easier to follow than the p5.play documentation alone.

**Demo**
I created a demo of sprite animations and basic controllers in the [demos folder](/demos).

If you want, use and adapt that code to get started!

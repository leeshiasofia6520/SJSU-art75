(work in progress)

--> This is for students who want to go deeper into P5 with Video. You can also display videos [embedded from YouTube/Vimeo](../03g_embeddingVideo_vimeoYouTube), or with the [HTML Video Tag](../03h_HTML5-video-tag).

You can use the [p5 DOM library](../05f_p5_6_workingWithDOM/) to create HTML Video Elements using P5.

Note the mouseOver functions WILL NOT work with mobile.

*Remember to [properly compress your videos](../../03h_HTML5-video-tag) before embedding them*

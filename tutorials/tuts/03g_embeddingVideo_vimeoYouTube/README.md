# What is an iframe tag?

An iframe is an HTML tag that allows you to embed content from another website. When you display videos in <iframe> code copied from YouTube/Vimeo, you are creating a little window on your site to the videos hosted on YouTube/Vimeo. 

This is great because you can have large files hosted by their servers, but you will have their logo unless you upgrade to a paid account.

# Embedding Videos
You can embed your video directly from vimeo or youtube using the HTML iframe tag. Here is a step by step guide:

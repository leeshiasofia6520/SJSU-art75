# â–¼â–³â–¼â–³â–¼ Audio recording checklist

#### 1. Minimize background noise

Listen for fans, refrigerators, air conditioning, buzz from flourescent lights â€” turn these off. Close windows to minimize street and traffic noise.

If somewhere is too noisy, move to a different location if possible.

Wind can also be very disruptive. Use furry wind muffs to help.

#### 2. Record room tone

Get ***at least*** 10 seconds of background noise. You will thank yourself in the editing room.

#### 3. Position the mic well

Listen through your headphones! This will help you figure out the best way to position it, especially when taking stereo into consideration.

Be mindful of what sound the mic might pick. Sometimes your hands holding the mic will make brushing noises against it. If it is placed on a table and someone is kicking the leg of the table, this could be very annoying.

If you are interviewing someone, place or hold the mic as close to their mouth without having the microphone get in the shot. Though it is best not to put it directly in front of their mouth, or else you will get "PUH" sounds when they say 'p' or 'b'.

#### 4. Levels! Always check your levels.

You want your audio to be as loud as possible without being too loud.

Background noises should be around -24 dB <br>
Voices  -12 to -6 dB <br>
Peaks  -6 dB.

***!! Do not let sound clip*** (go into the red zone). <br>   ðŸ˜ˆ Digital clipping is very bad - your sound cannot be recovered.

Check levels of your headphones as well - sometimes this can be very misleading.

# â–¼â–³â–¼â–³â–¼ Recording with the Zoom H4N


***Tips on using the H264 Zoom:***

1. It takes forever to turn on.

2. Check battery power if not using DC power. Make sure stamina mode is off (switch is inside battery cover).

3. Make sure there is enough room on the SD card. If not, format the card.

4. Check that you are recording WAV files - 44.1kHZ/16bit works well. You might want to note what folder they are being saved to.

5. You will most likely want to be in Stereo mode (in the mode menu), and have the top "mic" button activated on the front left -- this will use the built in stereo mics.

5. Click TWICE on record to start recording. The stop button will stop recording and save the clip. Hitting the record button again will make a marker on the clip, but it will keep recording.

6. Transferring footage to your computer. You can transfer using the SD card or by usb cable. If using USB cable, plug it in to the recorder *when it is turned off* then select "storage from the menu." It should show up on your computer as an external hard drive. The folders might take a minute to show up.

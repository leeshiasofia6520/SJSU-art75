# â–¼â–³â–¼â–³â–¼ Intro to Dynamic Links
Dynamic Link is the Adobe technology that allows you to pull files and functions from other Adobe apps into your Premiere project. It is designed to make your workflow easier and helps reduce rendering and the number of files you have to hand back and forth.

**Important:** Before starting- make sure you have the latest versions of **Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Audition** downloaded along with Premiere Pro. You can download and install these from Creative Cloud on your computer.  It is important that all versions are up to date so that they link properly.

For a full tutorial on Dynamic Links, including incorporating Adobe After Effects, go here for the [lynda.com tutorial on Dynamic Links and the Adobe Workflow](https://www.lynda.com/Premiere-Pro-tutorials/Premiere-Pro-Guru-Dynamic-Link-Adobe-Workflow/601824-2.html). We will not be diving into After Effects in this class, but you can expect to learn more in the advanced video class.


# â–¼â–³â–¼â–³â–¼ Editing Sound with Adobe Audition
Adobe Audition is a companion program to Premiere Pro to edit audio. Through dynamic links, you can hand files off back and forth between the programs.

What is helpful about working this way is that it is a **non-destructive workflow**. If at any point you change your mind, you can just right click on the audio file and choose â€˜Restore Unrenderedâ€™ to go back to your original track.

![Audio 1](images/Audio_1.png)
* In your Premiere sequence, either you use a separate audio track, or you can edit audio by right clicking on your clip and selecting 'unlink' to isolate your audio.

![Audio 1](images/Audio_2.png)
* You can press the '~' tilde key to expand the timeline and see your tracks larger.

![Audio 1](images/Audio_3.png)
* Right click on your audio track and select 'Edit Clip in Adobe Audition'

![Audio 1](images/Audio_19.png)
* Your clip will show up Audition.

![Audio 1](images/Audio_20.png)
* To make changes, you should select your whole track (if you plan to edit the entire clip) or a section (if you want to edit a specific part) by dragging across.

![Audio 1](images/Audio_21.png)
* After you have selected all or part that you would like to edit, you can then go to 'Effects' and apply changes to your audio.
* You can test out effects, but remember to proceed cautiously, trying out effects and undoing if you do not want to apply them to your track.

![Audio 1](images/Audio_4.png)
 * You can also use the slider that hovers on the waveforms of the tracks to change the decibel level, and manually change the loudness of the track.

![Audio 1](images/Audio_5.png)
* When you are ready to save, (Cmd/Ctrl + S) you can just save the audio.
* You can also save the audio as an Audition project 'Save As'. This is only necessary if you plan to go in and edit more in Audition later.

![Audio 1](images/Audio_6.png)
* Go back to Premiere. Your audio track should be then playing back with the edits.

![Audio 1](images/Audio_7.png)
* If you change your mind, or if the edits don't work for you, you can undo by right clicking, and selecting 'Restore Unrendered'.

![Audio 1](images/Audio_8.png)
* If you would like to edit more than one audio clip or track, you can go to Edit>Edit in Adobe Audition>Sequence...

![Audio 1](images/Audio_9.png)
* In the window, you can name the new sequence created and save it to your Video Workflow folder. Tip: Name it so you can keep track of it and save it in your audio folder.  

![Audio 1](images/Audio_10.png)
* You can select a section of your sequence to edit, or bring the entire sequence into Audition.
* You can also choose to bring in any audio effects you have already added here so that you can here them while editing in Audition.
* Make sure 'Open in Adobe Audition' checked.

![Audio 1](images/Audio_11.png)
* Your multi-track audio sequence will open in Audition. In this window

![Audio 1](images/Audio_12.png)
* You would proceed with adding effects and editing in the same way, choosing either the entire track, or a selection.
* In addition to the 'Effects' menu, the 'Essential Sound' menu on the right side of the workspace offers audio type specific editing options.

![Audio 1](images/Audio_22.png)
* In the lower right window you can also adjust clip volume using the slider.

![Audio 1](images/Audio_23.png)
* As your audio track plays, your video image plays in the lower right corner.

![Audio 1](images/Audio_24.png)
* The 'Essential Sound' menu offered in Audition is now also in Premiere in the Audio workspace.
* Remember that using Audition allows you to have a non-destructive workflow, and you can go back to your original material as needed.
* If you have a clear sense of your audio editing goals, then the 'Essential Sound' panel in Premiere is a direct tool.

![Audio 1](images/Audio_27.png)
* In both Audition and Premiere, the 'Essential Sound' panel offers audio specific editing menus.
* If your audio does not fit neatly into any of these categories, you can choose the nearest similar category, and try out edits from there.
* You can also transition to Audition after using this menu to make more precise edits.

![Audio 1](images/Audio_25.png)
* When working in the Audio workspace, expand the timeline so that you have a clearer view of your audio tracks and waveforms.
* You first select a track, then select the editing menu you want for it in the 'Essential Sound' menu.

![Audio 1](images/Audio_26.png)
* To move back to the main menu, click on 'Clear Audio Type'.

**And always remember to Save as you go!**





# â–¼â–³â–¼â–³â–¼ Using Photoshop with Premiere

Photoshop integrates very well with Premiere and is great for preparing still images, working with layered images, and  editing graphics for incorporation into your video project. You can also edit video files in Photoshop for more precise or Photoshop specific editing.

[For the lynda.com tutorial on Photoshop and Premiere and Dynamic Links click here.](https://www.lynda.com/Premiere-Pro-tutorials/Creating-new-Photoshop-file/601824/635506-4.html)

Before you begin, remember to prepare your files. Create a 'Photoshop Files' folder in your Source Media folder in your Video Workflow folder, and prepare any images you plan to use. Back in Premiere, follow the steps below to work with Photoshop.

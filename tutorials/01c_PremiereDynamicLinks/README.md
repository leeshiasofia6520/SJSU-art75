# â–¼â–³â–¼â–³â–¼ Intro to Dynamic Links
Dynamic Link is the Adobe technology that allows you to pull files and functions from other Adobe apps into your Premiere project. It is designed to make your workflow easier and helps reduce rendering and the number of files you have to hand back and forth.

**Important:** Before starting- make sure you have the latest versions of **Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Audition** downloaded along with Premiere Pro. You can download and install these from Creative Cloud on your computer.  It is important that all versions are up to date so that they link properly.

For a full tutorial on Dynamic Links, including incorporating Adobe After Effects, go here for the [lynda.com tutorial on Dynamic Links and the Adobe Workflow](https://www.lynda.com/Premiere-Pro-tutorials/Premiere-Pro-Guru-Dynamic-Link-Adobe-Workflow/601824-2.html). We will not be diving into After Effects in this class, but you can expect to learn more in the advanced video class.


# â–¼â–³â–¼â–³â–¼ Editing Sound with Adobe Audition
Adobe Audition is a companion program to Premiere Pro to edit audio. Through dynamic links, you can hand files off back and forth between the programs.

What is helpful about working this way is that it is a **non-destructive workflow**. If at any point you change your mind, you can just right click on the audio file and choose â€˜Restore Unrenderedâ€™ to go back to your original track.

# â–¼â–³â–¼â–³â–¼ Using Photoshop with Premiere

Photoshop integrates very well with Premiere and is great for preparing still images, working with layered images, and  editing graphics for incorporation into your video project. You can also edit video files in Photoshop for more precise or Photoshop specific editing.

# ▼△▼△▼ Setup

**Create a folder for all your in-class exercises.**

Organize your files with a consistent folder structure *that's the same for all your projects*. The easiest way to do this is to create a "workflow template" — a set of mostly empty folders that you copy and rename every time you start a new project.

Download the Video Workflow Template zip file in the [resources](../../resources) folder
  * Check out [this tutorial](https://www.techwalla.com/articles/how-to-open-a-mac-zip-file-in-windows) if you are having trouble unzipping it in Windows

It looks like this: <br>

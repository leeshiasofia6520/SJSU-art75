## Using the Osmo Mobile with Filmic Pro

The DJI Osmo Mobile is a gimbal: a device that helps to stabilize your footage. It will also create smooth pans and tilts, zooms, and object-tracking.

The two above tutorials use the DJI GO app to capture video. We are using Filmic Pro (which gives you more manual control of the image). To interface with Filmic Pro, check out this tut:

  * This tutorial is a few years old so the Filmic Pro interface looks a little different...

### Few important things for shooting with Osmo Mobile:
1. Make sure it is charged! It uses a strange audio-style miniplug.
2. Never balance the Osmo Mobile when it is turned on! Adjust the arms to balance your phone BEFORE turning it on. To do this, adjust the arms so that your phone balances horizontally, parallel to the ground.
2. First pair the Osmo with your phones bluetooth AND ALSO sync it to the DJI Go App (free, but you need to install), BEFORE syncing it with Filmic Pro

# â–¼â–³â–¼â–³â–¼ Aspect Ratio and Sequence

![Aspect Ratio](images/Premiere_1.png)

[Read and watch videos about resolution here](https://vimeo.com/blog/post/the-basics-of-image-resolution)

![Sequence](images/Premiere_11.png)

![Sequence](images/Premiere_12.png)



![Sequence](images/Premiere_9.png)

* When you drag a clip into the timeline, the new sequence in the timeline sets up settings to match that of the clip.
* If all of your clips are the same size and frame rate, then this is a good way to go.

* If your clips are different sizes and frame rates, and you have a specific outcome needed for your sequence, determine your aspect ratio and size by creating a sequence ahead of time.

![Sequence](images/Premiere_23.png)

* You can check your sequence settings by hovering over your sequence in the Project window (note: sequence icon vs stills vs audio/video)

![Sequence](images/Premiere_22.png)

* You can also right click and navigate to **'sequence settings'**

![Sequence](images/Premiere_21.png)

* Here you can make adjustments to the frame rate and aspect ratio if needed.


# â–¼â–³â–¼â–³â–¼ Targeting Tracks

![Timeline](images/Premiere_26.png)
- You can target tracks by pre-selecting V1 (video) or A1 (audio) before moving your clip to the timeline.

Timeline Tips:

# â–¼â–³â–¼â–³â–¼ Adding Still Images

![Aspect Ratio](images/Premiere_17.png)

* Create a new Bin in your Project window for your still images.

![Aspect Ratio](images/Premiere_16.png)

* Click open the bin and double click in the window to import your still images.
* Once imported, you can view your source images in the source monitor as you did with your video files.

![Aspect Ratio](images/Premiere_15.png)

* You can drag your still images from the source monitor to the timeline, as with your video files.
* To lengthen the amount of time that the still is in your video, drag one side or the other of the box on your timeline.

# â–¼â–³â–¼â–³â–¼ Picture in Picture

![Aspect Ratio](images/Premiere_14.png)
* To overlay a clip or still image on a sequence, first select your media file in your Project Panel and mark in/out if needed in the Source Monitor.
* Then drag from the Source Monitor to the Program Monitor, and a grid of options will appear> Hover and let go on **Overlay**
* Once you let go, the clip should appear in the V2 row of your timeline.
* You can then move it to the exact location in the sequence you would like.

![Aspect Ratio](images/Premiere_13.png)

* To resize the clip that is overlaid, click on the clip in the Program Monitor and a wireframe and crosshairs will appear
* Drag the wireframe until the clip is the size you would like
* Move the image to the screen location you would like in your overall video

# â–¼â–³â–¼â–³â–¼ Replace a Clip
++ in progress++

 dragging and holding option key

 if you want it to ripple = option delete
delete an area
-can use razor tool but in and outs is better ... use colon and apostrophe - this will only lift/extract the active tracks
Â 

# â–¼â–³â–¼â–³â–¼ Trimming a Clip
++ in progress++

- ripple edit tool 'b' or command keyboard modifier
- e = shortcut for extended edit - instead of dragging clip to cursor.
Â 
- rolling edit tool and rate stretch tool are hidden under ripple edit
Â 
option and arrow will trim left or right once edge is selected
Â 
if you want to edit just audio or video in synced clips, hold down option to just affect that track

# â–¼â–³â–¼â–³â–¼ Rate Stretch Tool

![Sequence](images/Premiere_18.png)

* To expand a clip on your timeline (beyond the out point you set in the Source Monitor) just drag the footage using your mouse on the timeline to change duration
* You can also right click on the clip and select **speed/duration** to make adjustments to the speed and duration.

# â–¼â–³â–¼â–³â–¼ Audio Adjustments
-->[links to more tutorials here](https://github.com/art75/SJSU-art75/tree/master/tutorials/01_Premiere#-working-with-audio)

++ in progress++

- difference between gain and volume
- to change audio configurations for source audio, right click in project window and go to modify -> audio channels
- shortcut for raising lowering volume is brackets
- add keyframes in timeline, command or control click on volume level bar itselfÂ Â 
- bracket shortcut applies to keyframes
- delete keyframes by just hitting delete
- dissolves = shift cmmd D
- show default length for cross dissolves in project settings

# â–¼â–³â–¼â–³â–¼ Expanded Color Correction

++ in progress++

workflow: correct individual shots and then shot to shot consistency

Basic tools

- lumetri scopes: parade and waveform

- auto color, auto contrast, auto levels are all obsolete effects that can help

lumetri color correctionÂ 
- hit auto at bottom

first do tone = exposure contrast
tone:
- highlights/shadows affect just them and not others
- whites/blacks = white/black point = adjust upper and lower limits
Â  Â  - common to raise white point and lower black point to make it more contrasty

white balance
- use dropper on a white point
